This is a dataset from only two subjects, each listening to one of the speakers. 
Please note that with this dataset you can only simulate the "speaker-independent" results.
For the code to automatically find the data, the 9 unzipped *.h5 files have to be placed inside the eeg folder, such as
BESD/data/Cocktail_Party/Normalized/2s/eeg/*.h5
